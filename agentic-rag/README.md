# Agentic RAG with LangGraph 🦜🔍

Implementation of Reflective RAG, Self-RAG & Adaptive RAG tailored towards developers and production-oriented applications for learning LangGraph🦜🕸️.

This repository contains a refactored version of the original [LangChain's Cookbook](https://github.com/mistralai/cookbook/tree/main/third_party/langchain),

## Features

- **Refactored Notebooks**: The original LangChain notebooks have been refactored to enhance readability, maintainability, and usability for developers.
- **Production-Oriented**: The codebase is designed with a focus on production readiness, allowing developers to seamlessly transition from experimentation to deployment.
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures the reliability and stability of the application, enabling developers to validate their implementations effectively.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation and branches guides developers through setting up the environment, understanding the codebase, and utilizing LangGraph effectively.


## What You'll Learn

- **Agentic RAG Implementation**: Build a system that can make intelligent decisions about retrieving information
- **Graph-Based Control Flow**: Use LangGraph to create sophisticated control flows for your RAG pipeline
- **Document Relevance Evaluation**: Implement logic to grade document relevance and detect hallucinations
- **Adaptive Information Retrieval**: Create a system that can switch between local knowledge and web search
- **State Management**: Implement proper state handling for complex information flows

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here 
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key_here 
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true                   
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=CRAG2                 
```

> **Important Note**: If you enable tracing by setting `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true`, you must have a valid LangSmith API key set in `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`. Without a valid API key, the application will throw an error.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Basic understanding of LLMs and RAG systems
- Familiarity with Python and vector databases (helpful but not required)


## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  pip run pytest . -s -v
```
